<p>During WWII, a broad national effort was mounted to foster a sense of patriotic duty for the war, and part of that effort were strong visual images that communicated the need for participation. So strong, in fact that the images of Uncle Sam and Rosie the Riveter continue to resonate today. Those iconic wartime posters served as a national call-to-action for everyone to get involved. In the spirit of our <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apply">fellowship</a>, we thought it would be fun to put a new spin on that theme. </p>
<p>Check out the posters below, and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/fellows/apply">apply now for the fellowship</a> — today is the deadline for applications! </p>
